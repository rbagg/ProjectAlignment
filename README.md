# Project Alignment Tool

## Overview

Project Alignment Tool is an intelligent application that solves one of the most persistent challenges in software development - keeping project documentation synchronized and ensuring alignment across all project artifacts. When PRDs, tickets, strategy documents, and other project materials get out of sync, teams struggle with miscommunication, wasted effort, and implementation errors.

This tool monitors changes across all connected project documents and automatically suggests updates to maintain alignment. When a ticket is added, it recommends how the PRD should be updated. When the PRD changes, it suggests what tickets should be created or modified. The system acts as a bridge between what has been written and what has been done, ensuring everyone stays on the same page.

## Pain Points Addressed

Development teams face numerous challenges when project documentation becomes inconsistent:

* Engineers implement features based on outdated PRDs, resulting in misaligned deliverables
* Product managers update requirements without corresponding ticket updates, causing confusion
* Strategy changes aren't reflected in implementation plans, leading to missed business objectives
* Time is wasted in meetings to reconcile different versions of requirements
* Lack of clear messaging about what changes were made and why, both internally and externally

These problems compound in larger organizations or complex projects where many stakeholders create and consume documentation across different tools and formats.

## Solution

Project Alignment Tool addresses these challenges by:

1. **Connecting documentation across tools**: Integrates with Google Docs (for PRDs/PRFAQs), Jira (for tickets), and Confluence (for strategy documents)
2. **Detecting meaningful changes**: Uses intelligent analysis to identify when sections, requirements, or tickets are added, modified, or removed
3. **Suggesting alignment updates**: Provides specific, actionable recommendations to keep documentation in sync
4. **Generating communication artifacts**: Automatically creates and maintains:
   - Project descriptions (what it is, pain points addressed, solution approach)
   - Internal messaging (for team communication)
   - External messaging (for customer communication)
5. **Analyzing change impact**: Evaluates if changes maintain project focus or indicate scope drift

The application features a minimalist, text-focused interface that prioritizes content and insights over complex UI elements.

## Key Benefits

Using Project Alignment Tool provides significant advantages for development teams:

* **Reduced miscommunication**: Everyone works from the same, up-to-date information
* **Time savings**: Eliminate hours spent reconciling different versions of documents
* **Improved quality**: Fewer implementation errors due to documentation inconsistencies
* **Better stakeholder alignment**: Clear, consistent messaging about the project and changes
* **Focus maintenance**: Early detection of scope creep or project drift
* **Streamlined communication**: Automatically generated artifacts for different audiences

## Technical Architecture

The application is built with a clean, modular architecture:

* Flask-based web application with SQLite database
* Integration modules for Google Docs, Jira, and Confluence
* Core services for synchronization, alignment analysis, and artifact generation
* Minimal UI with light background and dark text for readability

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* Flask and SQLAlchemy
* Access to Google Docs, Jira, and/or Confluence

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up environment variables for API access
4. Run the application: `python main.py`

### Basic Usage

1. Connect your project documents (PRDs, tickets, strategy)
2. The system will analyze them for initial alignment
3. As documents change, review suggested updates
4. Use the generated artifacts for team and customer communication

## Example Scenario

A product team is building a new feature. The product manager updates the PRD to modify the requirements. Project Alignment Tool:

1. Detects the changes in the PRD
2. Analyzes what tickets need to be updated
3. Suggests specific ticket changes to the engineering team
4. Generates updated internal messaging explaining the change rationale
5. Creates external messaging highlighting customer benefits of the change
6. Evaluates if the change maintains the project's original focus

This ensures the entire team understands what changed, why it changed, and what needs to be done to maintain alignment.

## Future Roadmap

* Enhanced AI-powered suggestion engine
* Additional integrations (GitHub, Notion, Asana)
* Automated ticket creation/updates
* Real-time collaborative alignment resolution
* Custom artifact templates
