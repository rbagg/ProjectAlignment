Configurable prompts for Project Alignment Tool

This file contains enhanced prompts with integrated Most Obvious Objections (MOO) approach
for all project artifacts. MOO is fully integrated by default, making all messaging
more comprehensive and proactive.

How to use this file:
1. Import the get_prompt function in your code
2. Call get_prompt with the prompt type and context
3. Use the returned prompt with the Claude API

Example:
    from prompts import get_prompt

    # Create context from your project data
    context = "Project information goes here..."

    # Get a specific prompt type (with optional variables)
    prompt = get_prompt('project_description', context, project_name="My Project")

    # Use the prompt with the Claude API
    response = call_claude_api(prompt)

# Project Description Prompt (with integrated MOO)
PROJECT_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT = """
You are a strategic product messaging expert who addresses stakeholder concerns preemptively.

Based on the following project information:
{context}

Create comprehensive project descriptions that both explain the project and address the most likely objections:

1. Three distinct sentences (20-30 words each) that articulate:
   - The project's core purpose and primary value proposition
   - The specific customer pain points it addresses (focus on emotional and practical impact)
   - The key technical/functional approach to solving these problems

2. Three well-structured paragraphs (3-4 sentences each) that expand on:
   - Paragraph 1: The project's essence, positioning, and strategic importance
   - Paragraph 2: The customer pain points, their business impact, and why existing solutions fall short
   - Paragraph 3: The solution architecture, key differentiators, and resulting customer benefits

3. Most Obvious Objections (1-3 items):
   - Identify the most probable stakeholder objections based on the project's scope, complexity, and approach
   - For each objection, provide a concise, evidence-based response that acknowledges the concern while reframing it constructively

Format as JSON:
{{
    "three_sentences": ["Sentence 1", "Sentence 2", "Sentence 3"],
    "three_paragraphs": ["Paragraph 1", "Paragraph 2", "Paragraph 3"],

            "response": "Clear response addressing this concern"
        }}
    ]
}}

Write in a professional yet accessible tone. Prioritize clarity and precision. Avoid marketing clich√©s and buzzwords. Use active voice and concrete language. Ensure objections are legitimate concerns a stakeholder would raise, not straw-man arguments.
